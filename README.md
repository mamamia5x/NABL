# NABL
This is old and I don't use the readme, so just ignore it.
To install this league, just add a new league in ZenGm and where it says Customize, click it and press add url. Then add this url - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamamia5x/NABL/master/File.JSON  
That's it. Enjoy (also, shuffling rosters is a good idea).

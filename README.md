# NABL
To install this league, just add a new league in ZenGm and where it says Customize, click it and press add url. Then add this url - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamamia5x/NABL/master/V1.JSON  
That's it. Enjoy (also, shuffling rosters is a good idea).  

# Info

# Error
For some reason, an error will happen when trying to upload the file. You can still play, but I don't know the effects of it. The file is an export from the game, I didn't actually program the JSON file. 

# Update's
V.1.0 - Released
